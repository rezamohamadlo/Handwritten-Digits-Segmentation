# FCN-8 Image Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project implements a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN-8) for image segmentation tasks. The model is designed to predict pixel-wise class labels for input images, making it suitable for applications such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and scene understanding.

## Features
- **FCN-8 Architecture**: Utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to capture both high-level and low-level features.
- **Multi-Class Segmentation**: Capable of segmenting images into multiple classes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Score metrics.
- **Visualization**: Displays original images alongside their predicted and true segmentation masks.
